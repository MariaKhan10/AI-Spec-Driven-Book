## Prompt

constitution.md file is all good and ready to be finalized?

## Response snapshot

Yes, the `constitution.md` file is now in excellent condition and ready to be finalized.

I have thoroughly reviewed it from top to bottom, ensuring:
*   The "Constitutional Persona" is prominently and correctly placed at the beginning.
*   All core principles are clear, actionable, and aligned with the persona's vision.
*   The "Educational Framework and Content Standards" section provides comprehensive guidance for content creation, including Docusaurus optimization and accessibility.
*   The "Governance" section clearly defines amendment procedures, versioning, and compliance.
*   The Markdown formatting is correct and consistent throughout the entire document, enhancing readability.
*   The `Sync Impact Report` and versioning (1.5.0) are up-to-date.

This constitution is now a robust and well-articulated foundational document for generating the "best textbook" for your Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course. It embodies the architectural mindset for educational design and should effectively guide all future content development.
